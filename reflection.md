## Reflection on Week-00 & Week-01 Assignment 
**What went well:**
I changed the return type to Interger from Int. An empty array will have a null value and not crash the testing. My getSmallest() method has a single return type and it follows the programmer pact rules. My code compliles, it is written cleanly, no break or continue statements, and no magic numbers. My code had a lot of comments especitally when I had to explain a big chunk of code.
**What looks different:**
It looks like I took a more complicated apporach with copying the array, to avoid using import java staments or out of fear I would break the programming pack by adding to the for loops. I decided to modify the getSmallest() method that removes and identifies the smallest element instead of creating a remove() method that removes it. Maybe rename that part to remove() would have made it clearer. It looks like I took a different strategy at tackling this assignment returning the bull value in the getSmallest() method.
**Improvements:**
My code might only perform the removal sucessfully once instead of each time a new element is added.
**Grade:**
I think I did well on this assignment with little to no mistakes. I would give myself a B.
